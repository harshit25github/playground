# DOM 13 - Reels (Event Bubbling/Delegation) Skeleton

Goal: event bubbling + event delegation ko practice karna using an Instagram Reels like UI.

## Run

Open `index.html` in your browser.

## What you will practice

- One listener on parent (delegation)
- `e.target` vs `e.currentTarget`
- `closest()` to find which button/item was clicked
- Bubbling order (child → parent → document)
- `stopPropagation()` and where it makes sense
- `preventDefault()` (if you add links/forms)

## Suggested features (TODO)

- Like toggle per reel (heart + count)
- Save toggle
- Mute/unmute per reel
- Comment drawer open/close
- Click on video area: play/pause (UI only in this skeleton)
- Click on username: open profile (can be preventDefault demo)
- Progress bar update (optional)
