# 30 - Next.js (scaffold)

This folder is intentionally “instructions only”, because Next.js needs npm packages.

## Create a Next.js app

From repo root:

```sh
cd playground/30-nextjs
npx create-next-app@latest .
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What to build (suggestion)

- UI for `/api/todos` from your Node API
- Learn: routing, server vs client components, API routes, env vars
