# 20 - React (scaffold)

This folder is intentionally “instructions only”, because React needs npm packages.

## Create a React app (recommended: Vite)

From repo root:

```sh
cd playground/20-react
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What to build (suggestion)

- Todo app that calls your API in `playground/10-node-http-api/`
- Pages: list, create, toggle done, delete
- Concepts: components, props, state, `useEffect`, forms, fetch, error/loading UI
