         A: It avoids a flash of unstyled content and lets the browser start layout with styles applied.
         Reasoning: the parser discovers CSS early and can block rendering until styles are ready. -->

    <!-- Local script runs after the libraries load and after #root exists -->
    <!-- index.js typically calls ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')) -->
    <script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>

    <!-- Curious interview-style questions with reasoning:
         - Q: Why are scripts placed at the end of the body instead of the head?
           A: So the DOM (like #root) is available; alternatively use `defer` in the head.
           Reasoning: blocking scripts in the head pause HTML parsing and can delay first paint.
         - Q: What breaks if index.js runs before the #root element exists?
           A: `document.getElementById('root')` returns null and ReactDOM.createRoot(null) throws.
           Reasoning: React needs a real DOM node to mount into and cannot mount to null.
         - Q: Why does ReactDOM need React to load first?
           A: ReactDOM uses the React API to create and reconcile elements.
           Reasoning: the UMD build attaches globals in load order; ReactDOM expects React to exist.
         - Q: What is the difference between development and production builds of React?
           A: Dev builds include warnings and extra checks; prod builds are smaller and faster.
           Reasoning: dev adds safety and debug hints, prod strips them for performance.
         - Q: Why use the UMD builds from a CDN rather than a bundler?
           A: Quick setup for learning; bundlers give tree-shaking and better production output.
           Reasoning: UMD avoids build steps, but bundlers optimize and manage dependencies.
         - Q: What does the crossorigin attribute change for script loading and error reporting?
           A: It enables CORS mode so browsers can surface detailed error stacks and allow SRI.
           Reasoning: without CORS, errors become "Script error" and SRI can be blocked.
         - Q: What are the tradeoffs of using a CDN (caching, availability, privacy, CSP)?
           A: Faster cached loads but adds external dependency and CSP/privacy considerations.
           Reasoning: CDNs improve cache hit rates, but you depend on third-party uptime and policy.
         - Q: How would you add integrity checks (SRI) for CDN scripts?
           A: Add `integrity=\"...\"` and `crossorigin=\"anonymous\"` with the CDN hash.
           Reasoning: SRI lets the browser verify the file hash before executing it.
         - Q: Why use a single root node instead of multiple mount points?
           A: A single root keeps React tree cohesive; multiple roots are possible but split state.
           Reasoning: one tree is easier to manage and avoids cross-root coordination.
         - Q: How would you convert this to type=\"module\" and import from esm builds?
           A: Use `<script type=\"module\">` and import from `https://esm.sh/...` or similar.
           Reasoning: ESM lets you use native imports but requires compatible CDN endpoints.
         - Q: What happens if index.css is loaded at the end of the body?
           A: The page may flash unstyled content before CSS loads.
           Reasoning: styles are discovered late, so the browser paints default styles first.
         - Q: How do you verify React is actually rendering (e.g., check createRoot output)?
           A: Inspect the DOM, add console logs, or render visible text and confirm it appears.
           Reasoning: direct evidence in the DOM or logs confirms the render pipeline ran.
